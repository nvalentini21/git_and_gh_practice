One of my favorite travel experiences was in Anacortes, Washington. I got to spend three hours on a wolf rescue reserve, hiking alongside wolves (literally was walking a wolf on a lead right next to me), interacting with them, learning about them, and learning about the great things the rescue did to help these animals. They also had a lot of rescued wild cats; all equally adorable.
