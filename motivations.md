I love naturopathic medicine, but current times have made it more difficult to practice (COVID conflict), and I see it more as a genuine hobby/interest than a career path. Going to Turing and becoming a software engineer offers exactly what I want in life: financial security, opportunity for tons of creativity and problem solving, and a good work/social/life balance. Eventually, if I chose to practice medicine on the side, I would like it to be completely untied to financial concerns, and truly because I like to help people. Software engineering I know one day will allow me to do that, and additionally I hope to merge the two fields and create a situation in which I can mesh the two.
